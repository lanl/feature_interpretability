Pytorch Nested Cylinder Models
#################################################

Straightfoward CNNs were developed in pytorch to estimate the scaling of a Preston-Tonks-Wallace (PTW) strength model from a nested cylinder experiment.

Model Inputs & Outputs
=============================

Networks trained on nested cylinder data take as input an image showing the density throughout the experiment. An example density field is shown below.

These models predict the value that the PTW strength model was scaled by.

Running the Nested Cylinder Example
=======================================

To run the scripts on the pytorch nested cylinder networks, use the following arguments: 

 - ``--PACKAGE pytorch``
 - ``--EXPERIMENT nestedcylinder``
 - ``--MODEL ../examples/pyt_nestedcyl/trained_rho2PTW_model.pth``
 - ``--INPUT_FIELD rho``
 - ``--INPUT_NPZ`` use any .npz file in ``../examples/pyt_nestedcyl/data/``
 - ``--INPUT_DIR ../examples/pyt_nestedcyl/data/``
 - ``--DESING_FILE ../examples/pyt_nestedcyl/nestedcyl_design_file.csv``
 - ``--FIXED_KEY id0643``, ``--FIXED_KEY idx00130``, or ``--FIXED_KEY None``  

Nested Cylinder Data
=========================

The file names of nested cylinder data contain multiple pieces of information about their contents. The two relevent componets are the **id** and the **idx**:

- The *id* is followed by a number identifying the experiment ID. 
   - The value of ``PTW_scale`` is identical across files with identical *id* 's.
   - Data is included for *id0643* at all 22 timesteps.
- The *idx* specifies what time step the simulation was at. 
   - The value of the ``sim_time`` will be identical across files with identical *idx* 's.
   - Data is included at *idx00112* for 31 differnt simulations.

Each ``.npz`` nested cylinder data file contains the following fields:

 - *sim_time* (scalar): simulation time stamp corresponding to a unique *idx* value
 - *rho* (2D array): density training field (use ``-IN_FIELD rho``)
 - *hr_outerWall*, *hr_bottomWall*, *hr_mcSide*, *hr_mcBottom*, *hr_innerCylClide*, *hr_innerCylBottom*, *hr_MOI (2D arrays): density of simulation compoment
 - *hr_innerCylBottom*, *hr_innerCylCorner*, *hr_innerCylRight* (2D arrays): density of an inner cylinder component
 - *volhr_outerWall*, *volhr_bottomWall*, *volhr_mcSide*, *volhr_mcBottom*, *volhr_innerCylSide*, *volhr_innerCylBottom*, *volhr_MOI* (shape): thing
 - *pressure* (2D array)
 - *temperature* (2D array)
 - *melt_state* (2D array): binary array of if a cell has melted
 - *porosity* (2D array)
 - *eqps* (2D array): equivalent plastic stress
 - *eqps_rate* (2D array): equivalent plastic stress rate
 - *eff_stress* (2D array): effective stress
 - *bulk_mod* (2D array): bulk modulus of the material
 - *sound_speed* (2D array): speed of sound in the material
 - *rVel* (2D array): veliocty of material in the R-axis direction
 - *zVel* (2D array): velocity of material in the Z-axis direction
 - *Rcoord* (1D vector): vector containing position in cm of all cells along the R-axis
 - *Zcoord* (1D vector): vector containing position in cm of all cells along the Z-axis

Model Architecture
=============================

These models consist of a single branch that passes the image input straight forward through the network.

Model Layers
=============================

The layers in model follow the following naming convention:

- **in???**: layer near top of the network
- **??Conv??**: 2D convolutional layer
- **??Norm??**: 2D batch normalization layer
- **??Activation**: GELU activation layer
- **interp_module.??.##**: layer in "interpretability stack"
- **reduction_module.??.##**: layer in the "reduction stack", which reduced layer size by using a stride â‰  (1,1)
- **end???**: layer near the end of the model
- **hidden**: linear hidden layer
- **hidden#Activation**: GELU activation layer after a hidden layer
- **linOut**: linear layer that generates output
- **flattenLayer_##**: ``torch.nn.Flatten()`` layer
