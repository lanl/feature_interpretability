# Feature Interpretability

This folder of code contains tools for extracting, plotting, and computing with features extracted from nerual networks. While these tools are intended to be easily maluable to new networks and new datasets, they are not guarenteed to work outside of these settings.

These tools were developed by **Skylar Callis**. They developed this code while working as a post-bachelors student at [Los Alamos National Lab](https://www.lanl.gov/?source=globalheader) from 2022 - 2024. To see what they are up to these days, visit [Skylar's Website ](https://skylar-jean.com).

To generate the most up-to-date documetaion, run the following commands in the `./docs/` directory:

 - `make clean` to remove existing build docs
 - `make html` to create the new docs
 - open `./docs/build/html/index.html` to view rendered docs

The documentation for this code can be found [locally](./docs/build/html/index.html) and at [url coming soon]().

The github page for this code can be found at [url coming soon]().
