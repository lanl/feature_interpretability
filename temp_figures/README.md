# Feature Interpretability Temp Figures Directory

This directory is intended to be used as temporary storage for figures/other script output. It is not tracked by git. 

Everytime a script is run and everytime the `fns` module is imported, all files in this directory are deleted. Make sure to save important files elsewhere.
